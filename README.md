# ET_learning

In this repository, I will be uploading everything I am going to learn about the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python, SQL, and other technologies.

### What is ETL?

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a large, central repository called a data warehouse. It involves extracting raw data from different data sources, transforming it based on business rules (cleaning, organizing, and structuring), and then loading it into a target database or data warehouse.

ETL is a crucial process for data integration, preparing data for storage, analysis, and machine learning (ML).

### Repository Structure

- **Python Scripts**: This folder contains scripts for the ETL process using Python.
- **SQL Queries**: Includes SQL scripts to extract and manipulate data.
- **Other Technologies**: Contains ETL processes implemented using different tools or technologies.
- **Data**: Sample data files that are used in the learning process.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting and automating the ETL process.
- **SQL**: For data extraction and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data transformation and cleaning in Python.
- **Other Technologies**: Additional tools that might be explored in the ETL process.

### Learning Goals

1. Understand the full ETL process.
2. Explore different methods of data extraction from multiple sources.
3. Learn data transformation techniques using Python and SQL.
4. Load cleaned and transformed data into a database or data warehouse.
5. Practice and apply ETL concepts to real-world scenarios.
